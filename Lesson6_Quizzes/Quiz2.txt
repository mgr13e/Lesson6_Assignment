Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

appendChild()
 insertBefore()

A node added with appendChild() is always put in after any of the existing child
nodes.

The insertBefore() method lets us control and specify the order that we insert the node with all the others.



2.  List the six main objects that make up the browser object model. 

Window, History, Location, Navigator, Screen, and Document.
